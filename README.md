# Predicting Bronx Pickup and Dropoff Locations using Machine Learning Models

This project focuses on predicting pickup and dropoff locations in the Bronx using three popular machine learning models: Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). By training these models on historical taxi trip data, we aim to develop predictive models that can accurately forecast the pickup and dropoff locations for future taxi rides in the Bronx.

## Data Preparation
The first step in this project is to collect and preprocess the taxi trip data for the Bronx. The dataset will include various features such as pickup and dropoff timestamps, coordinates, trip duration, and other relevant information. We will split the data into training and testing sets to ensure model evaluation accuracy.

## Model Training
Once the data is ready, we will proceed to train the three machine learning models: Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and SVM. Each model will be fine-tuned using hyperparameter optimization techniques to achieve the best performance. Cross-validation will be utilized to avoid overfitting and assess model generalization capabilities.

## Model Evaluation
Formed an accuracy calculation on the match of predicted locations to the real-life location
